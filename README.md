Follow the below steps to run experiments in Matlab.

Step 1: Unzip each folder in the folder Table II. These folders' names are the same as the names of 12 scenarios in Table II. 

Step 2: In the algorithm folder of these folders, run *.m files in the folder of GD (the related work) or of OL (our proposed work). 

Step 3: When the experiments are completed, their results will be automatically stored as *.mat files in the corresponding folder, i.e., GD folder or OL folder, in the ouput folder.
