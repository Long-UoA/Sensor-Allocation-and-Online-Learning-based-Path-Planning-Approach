Follow the below steps to run experiments in Matlab.

- Run the file OL_2cams_3targets_1horizons_10000TimeStamps_0.m to do the experiment.
  Here, the file scenario_2cams_3targets_1horizons_10000TimeStamps_0.mat which includes the number of cameras and vessels, and their initial positions should be the input.

- When the experiment is finished, the results will be stored in the file output_OL_2cams_3targets_1horizons_10000TimeStamps_0.mat.

- Run the file plot_results.m to visualize the results.
  
- To reproduce the results in Table 2 in the paper, have access to the code at this link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ukXOiKAxcEhNU-_KFl9iw_tCcfU_x2KZ?usp=sharing
