Follow the below steps to run experiments in Matlab.

- Run the file OL_2cams_3targets_1horizons_10000TimeStamps_0.m.
  Here, the file scenario_2cams_3targets_1horizons_10000TimeStamps_0.mat should be the input file which includes the number of cameras and vessels, and their initial positions.

- Atfer the experiment is done, the results will be save as the file output_OL_2cams_3targets_1horizons_10000TimeStamps_0.mat.

- Run the file plot_results.m to visulise the results.
